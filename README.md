<!-- This should be the title of your project, something employers will see --maybe Friends Trivia? -->

## Description:
<!-- I'd ditch the colons -->
* This trivia game tests the users' knowledge of Friends in 60 seconds. Choose from the easy, medium and hard decks, or play all three!
* Play Friends Trivia [here](https://stellagordonzigel.github.io/trivia_game/)

## User Stories
* When I load the page, easy, medium and hard level buttons should be displayed
* When I click a level, a 60 second timer should begin and the first question should appear
* When I select an answer (either right or wrong), the next question should appear
* If I answer every question, or the timer runs out (whichever comes first), my score should pop up
* When I click 'ok' the easy, medium and hard level buttons should re-appear and I can select the level I'd like to play

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery

## Installation Instructions:
<!-- Nice! -->
* Fork this repository (trivia_game)
* Clone it to your local repository
* Open index.html, style.css, script.js, easy.js, medium.js, hard.js, friends_logo.png, and FRIENDS_.TTF in a text editor of your choice

## Unsolved Problems:
* I wanted to give the user an indication of whether or not their answers were correct as they were making a selection. Initially, I used alerts for this, but felt the user experience was negatively impacted by having to click ‘ok’ on the alert to move on to the next question. I wanted something to pop up and quickly disappear so the experience was not impacted.
* In addition to the timer and final score, I wanted to show the user which question they were on out of the total number of questions. (example: 7/15)

<!-- You can do both of these things with jquery, and changing the text of an element.  Glad you're thinking ahead! -->
